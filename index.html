					<p> Hello my name is
						Matt Nemeth. I am a computer
						engineering student studying at the
						University of Cincinnati. I will graduate in May of 2021.
						I have previous experience working on a
						Digital Design team at L3 Technologies
						in Mason, Ohio. I am looking for a
						position in software development as I
						have found the software side of
						computer engineering to be more
						enjoyable.<br><br> Away from the computer I
						enjoy snowboarding, skateboarding, and
						darts. I am a fan of all things
						Cleveland. I am also a founding father of
						the Beta Sigma Chapter of Alpha Sigma
						Phi at UC.

						<h2>Cricket GUI</h2>
						<p>I have always enjoyed the game of
							darts. There is something about the
							game being so simple yet so difficult that I enjoy. 
							My roommates and I always keep score in our heads since we do not have a chalkboard
							so I decided I
							would try and make some sort of GUI to
							keep track of score. There are many
							applications and websites that already
							do this but I wanted to try my hand at
							making my own.<br>
							While it is not the prettiest thing in the world, it functions. And that is what is important to me.
							There are many bells and whistles I plan to add but for now it works for what we need.

						<h2>Daily Coding Problems</h2> 
						<p>I have been subscribed to <a href="#"><b>Daily Coding Problems</b></a> for some time now.
							I think this is one of the best ways to
							practice for interview questions and
							become better at problem solving. I
							have just recently decided to try and
							start uploading my answers to a Github
							repository. You can check them out <a href="https://github.com/MattNemeth/dailyCodingProblems"><b>here.</b></a>

					<h2>Overview</h2> 
					<p>I have spent my
						first three co-op semesters at L3
						Techonologies located in Mason, Ohio.
						Each semester I was a part of their
						Digital Design group working on the
						logic inside of their FPGA's for their
						cameras.
					</p> 
					<h2>Responsibilites</h2>
					<ul> 
						<li>Submit Change notices and ensure that all relevant documentation is up to date</li> 
						<li>Develop reusable, generic VHDL synchronizers</li> 
						<li>Created a schematic from a port list</li> 
						<li>Collaborated with other engineers to ensure obsolete parts on our PCBs had working replacements</li> 
					</ul> 
					<h2>What I Learned</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li>The importance of being attentitive to details</li> 
						<li>Creating a plan instead of jumping right in can save enormous amounts of time</li> 
						<li>Books are important! While the internet is extremely useful, books are also a very valuable resource</li> 
						<li>Digital Design is not for me!</li>
