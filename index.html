					<p> Hello my name is
						Matt Nemeth. I am a computer
						engineering student studying at the
						University of Cincinnati. I will graduate in May of 2021.
						I have previous experience working on a
						Digital Design team at L3 Technologies
						in Mason, Ohio. I am looking for a
						position in software development as I
						have found the software side of
						computer engineering to be more
						enjoyable.<br><br> Away from the computer I
						enjoy snowboarding, skateboarding, and
						darts. I am a fan of all things
						Cleveland. I am also a founding father of
						the Beta Sigma Chapter of Alpha Sigma
						Phi at UC.

						<h2>Cricket GUI</h2>
						<p id="cricketP">I have always enjoyed the game of
							darts. There is something about the
							game being so simple yet so difficult that I enjoy. 
							My roommates and I had always kept score in our heads since we do not have a chalkboard
							. I decided I
							would try and make some sort of GUI to
							keep track of score more easily. There are many
							applications and websites that already
							do this but I wanted to try my hand at
							making my own. Many other sites often have lots of other features and games that I was
							not interested in. <br> <br> I decided to build it using Java with Netbeans IDE.
							Prior to this project, my only experience with each of these was a simple
							"Hello World" program. After some research, I concluded that creating
							a Swing GUI would be the best place to start. I began by sketching 
							a design of how I would like the GUI to look. After playing around 
							in the IDE for a bit, I ended with this design:
							<br>
						</p>
							<div id="GUIimg">
								<img src="./img/CricketGUI.png">
							</div>
						<p>
							While the interface itself isn't exactly eye catching, it functions. 
							And that is exactly what my roommates and I needed.
							Users can interact with the GUI by hitting a "+1" when they score a dart in that section.
							This makes scoring very simple. After you score, you tap the screen a few times and
							continue to play. This program allowed us to play more games in less time since we did
							did not have to stop and make sure the score in our heads was correct.

						<h1>L3 Technologies - Space and Sensors Sector, Engineering Intern</h1>
					</div>
					<h2>Overview</h2> 
					<p>I have spent my
						first three co-op semesters at L3
						Techonologies located in Mason, Ohio.
						Each semester I was a part of their
						Digital Design group working on the digital logic
						logic inside of their FPGA's for their
						cameras.
					</p> 
					<h2>Responsibilites</h2>
					<ul> 
						<li>Submit Change notices and ensure that all relevant documentation is up to date</li> 
						<li>Develop reusable, generic VHDL synchronizers</li> 
						<li>Created a schematic from a port list</li> 
						<li>Collaborated with other engineers to ensure obsolete parts on our PCBs had working replacements</li> 
					</ul> 
					<h2>What I Learned</h2> 
					<ul>
						<li><p>The Devil is in the Details!<br><br>
						       During my third semester I was given more difficult taks. I quickly realized the importance of 
						       being attentitive to details. The smallest differences can make the biggest changes and it is important
						       as an engineer to notice them.</li> 

						<li><p> Create a Plan!<br><br> Creating a plan instead of jumping right in can save enormous amounts of time.
						       What I found to be most effective was to draw out my ideas before I get started. Once I felt I thought
						       through exactly what needed to be done, I confirmed my understanding and plan with other engineers.
						       It can be difficult but it is important to resist the urge to jump right in.
						</p></li> 

						<li><p>Books are important!<br><br> While the internet is extremely useful, books are a very valuable resource
						       that should not be forgotten!
						</p></li> 

						<li><p>Digital Design is not for me!<br><br> While I enjoyed the opportunity to work
					       	       with highly intelligent individuals and learn a lot about how to design high level circuits,
						       I do not have the passion for the work. With almost every small project I have done at home,
						       they are all software related. Sometimes it is more helpful to learn what you don't like than what you love
						</p></li>
